# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in C++

This repository contains implementations of various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++. The purpose is to demonstrate fundamental OOP principles through practical examples.

## 1. Introduction
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design applications. It helps in organizing code, promoting reusability, and managing complexity.

## 2. Concepts Covered
This repository includes the following OOP concepts:
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class).
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones.
- **Polymorphism**: Using a single interface to represent different data types.
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex details and exposing only the essentials.
## 3. How to Run
To run the programs, you need a C++ compiler like `g++`
